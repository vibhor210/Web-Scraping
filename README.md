# Web-Scraping
I use various libraries like bs4, pandas, requests, json, psycopg2.
### bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
BS4 is used to extract text from html tags in web scraping.
### pandas
I used pandas for extracting data from .csv files.
### requests
The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.
### json
JavaScript object notation(JSON) is syntax for storing and exchanging data.
There has a built-in package in python named json.
### psycopg2
psycopg2 is package in python and PostgreSql database adapter. By using this we can use postgreSql from our python code.
We can perform curd operation from our code in PostgreSql DB.

# script.py
Code in this file, will bumped data(which is scraped form the url) in output.json file.

# script_pgSql.py
Code in this file, will bumped data(which is scraped form the url) in output.json file as well as in the postgreSql database.
